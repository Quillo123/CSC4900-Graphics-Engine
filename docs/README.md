# Website
As a part of this project, I was tasked with creating a website for explaining my application. You can find this website on my GitHub.io site. 

For more information, please visit the project site. The site has overview of the project, OpenGL, my experiences, and some of the fundamentals needed to understand the application. [Graphics Engine](https://quillo123.github.io/CSC4900-Graphics-Engine/)

## CSC4900 Wiki

This repository is part of an independent study course at Seattle Pacific University, in partnership with Dr. Carlos Arias. 

For more info on the project, please visit my GitHub IO site: [CSC4900 Graphics Engine](https://quillo123.github.io/CSC4900-Graphics-Engine/index.html)

You can also find a sample application in the repository which shows you how to use the Engine properly.
